 Input Format
 
 You do not need to read any input from stdin. Our grader will pass the root node of a binary tree to your height function.
 
 Output Format
 
 Your function should return a single integer denoting the height of the binary tree.

 Input Format
 
 You are given a function,

 Output Format
 
 Print the values on a single line separated by space.
 
 Sample Input
 
 3

/**
 *  You are given a pointer to the root of a binary tree. You need to print the level order traversal of this tree. In level order traversal, we visit the nodes level by level from left to right.
 You only have to complete the function.
 For example:
 
 3
 /   \
 5     2
 / \    /
 1   4  6
 For the above tree, the level order traversal is 3 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 6.
 
 Input Format
 
 You are given a function,
 
 void level_order(node * root)
 {

 Output Format
 
 Print the values in a single line seperated by a space.
 
 Sample Input
 
 3
 /   \
 5     2
 / \    /
 1   4  6
 Sample Output
 
 3 5 2 1 4 6
 Explanation
 
 Level 1:        3
 /   \
 Level 2:     5     2
 / \    /
 Level 3:   1   4  6
 We need to print the nodes level by level. We process each level from left to right.
